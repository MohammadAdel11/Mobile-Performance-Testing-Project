# Redz Mobile Automation Testing Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the QA Bootcamp **Mobile Automation Testing Project**.  
Our goal is to apply the full software testing process on a **mobile application** using **Appium, Java, and TestNG** while following the **Scrum methodology**.

We selected the **Redz Application** (available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.homyt.thex&pcampaignid=web_share)) as our **System Under Test (SUT)**.  
The project simulates a real QA working environment, where the team collaborates to plan, design, implement, and present automation workflows for core app features.
